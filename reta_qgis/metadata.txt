description=Spatial data filtering with sequential operational, global, and local outlier detection for agricultural sensor data.
about=RETA (Robust Error-treatment Toolkit for Agriculture) provides a full pipeline
    for spatial data cleaning: turn detection, overlap detection, speed/acceleration
    filtering, AOI-based global outlier removal, local spatial outlier detection,
    and cross-track correction.

    RETA is adapted from and builds upon the methods described in Yield Editor 2.0:
    Sudduth, K. A., Drummond, S. T., & Myers, D. B. (2012, July 29-August 1).

    Agentic coding AI was used to develop this tool with human guidance and oversight.

    Dependencies: numpy, pandas, pyproj, scipy (optional, for convex hull area).
